    category: "SEO & Branding",
    problem: "TechFlow had a dated brand identity and was struggling to rank for competitive SaaS keywords. Their organic traffic had plateaued and they were losing market share to newer competitors.",
    solution: "We conducted a comprehensive brand audit and redesigned their visual identity. Implemented a technical SEO overhaul, created a content strategy targeting high-intent keywords, and built authoritative backlinks through strategic outreach.",

    category: "Web Design",
    problem: "GreenLeaf's existing website had a 0.8% conversion rate, poor mobile experience, and a checkout process that caused 70% cart abandonment. Revenue was stagnating despite growing traffic.",
    solution: "Designed and developed a custom Shopify theme optimized for conversions. Implemented one-click checkout, improved product photography presentation, added trust signals, and created a seamless mobile-first experience.",

    description: "Google Ads campaign delivering 8x ROAS consistently",
    category: "Google Ads",
    problem: "FinanceHub was spending $50K/month on Google Ads with only 2x ROAS. High CPCs in the competitive finance niche were eating into margins, and they couldn't scale profitably.",
    solution: "Restructured campaigns with tight ad groups and negative keyword lists. Implemented smart bidding strategies, created high-converting landing pages, and developed a remarketing funnel to capture warm leads.",
    result: "Achieved consistent 8x ROAS while scaling spend to $150K/month. Cost per acquisition dropped by 60%. Generated $1.2M in attributable revenue within the first quarter.",

    description: "Local SEO strategy resulting in #1 rankings across 15 keywords",
    category: "SEO",
    problem: "HealthFirst was invisible in local search results, ranking on page 3+ for key terms. Competitors dominated the Google Map Pack, and the clinic was losing patients to nearby practices.",
    solution: "Optimized Google Business Profile, built local citations, implemented schema markup, and created location-specific content. Developed a review generation strategy and built local backlinks from health directories.",
    result: "#1 rankings for 15 high-value local keywords. Appeared in Google Map Pack for all target searches. New patient inquiries increased by 400%. Became the top-rated clinic in the area with 200+ 5-star reviews.",

    title: "AutoMate AI",

    category: "AI Consulting",
    problem: "AutoMate's team was drowning in repetitive tasks—data entry, report generation, and customer follow-ups consumed 60+ hours weekly. Growth was limited by operational bottlenecks.",
    solution: "Audited existing workflows and identified automation opportunities. Implemented AI-powered solutions for data processing, built custom GPT integrations for customer communications, and created automated reporting dashboards.",
    result: "Reduced manual work by 40 hours per week. Team productivity increased by 65%. Enabled the company to scale operations without additional hires. ROI achieved within 2 months.",
  },
  {
    title: "StyleBox Fashion",
    description: "Meta Ads scaling from $5K to $50K monthly spend profitably",
    category: "Meta Ads",
    problem: "StyleBox couldn't scale their Meta Ads beyond $5K/month without seeing diminishing returns. Creative fatigue was constant, and audience targeting had become ineffective.",
    solution: "Developed a creative testing framework with 20+ ad variations monthly. Implemented broad targeting with creative-led optimization, built a full-funnel campaign structure, and created UGC-style content that resonated with the audience.",
    result: "Scaled from $5K to $50K monthly spend while maintaining 4x ROAS. Customer acquisition cost remained stable during scaling. Generated $2.4M in revenue from Meta Ads alone in 12 months.",
